        DOSIJEM uses services whose providers are partly located in so-called
        third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic
        Area) or process personal data there, i.e. countries whose level of data
        protection does not correspond to that of the European Union. Where this
        is the case and the European Commission has not issued an adequacy
        decision (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we have taken appropriate
        precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data
        transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses
        of the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Moreover, where this is the case we will only share the minimal amount
        of personal data necessary for the purpose of processing and, where
        possible, we will share the personal data in an anonymised form.
